### Health website

## About
This is a personal project to summarise health advice in a simple web application. Online health advice can be overwhelming and inconsistent. News organisations often give an incomplete picture, as they prioritise surprising, trendy or counter-intutitive findings. While the information exists online, it can be difficult or time-consuming to find. 

The current content is a placeholder only and is intended to be indicative of the type of content on the site.

## Structure
The web application uses the Flask framework with Javascript logic in the front end to ensure a responsive user experience. The health advice is stored in a JSON file which is passed to the application which renders it on screen. The user can apply filters which are implemented in Javascript. 

The website uses the Bootstrap framework to enable mobile responsive design.
